  title: About Me
---

Hi I’m Fatimah and I’m in my twenties. I decided to start this blog to share some information about life and not just the important things like lessons from university and getting your first apartment, but also fun things like my travel experiences and how I do so as a graduate student on a limited budget AND still save for emergencies. I also dabble in hair & makeup and would love to talk about my favorite natural curly hair products and brown skin friendly makeup. Keep checking in every week for new content.
